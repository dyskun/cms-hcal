CMS-HCAL instrumentation | High energy physics project | Microscopic characterisation of Hybrid Photo Diode

This repository hosts the resources I created/found while working on a research project in the Department of High Energy Physics at TIFR in Mumbai, India. In this project I studied the radiation damage in a Hybrid Photo Diode that was decommissioned from the Hadronic Calorimerer of CMS detector. 

### Directories
#### `assignments`
If you are working on CMS-HCAL, doesn't matter if it is theory or instrumentation, you should definitely go through the `assignments` folder. These assignments were a part of my training for this project. I spent almost 3 to 4 months on learning about the instrumentation of CMS-HCAL. This is to say that there's a lot of informative stuff that you should know about CMS-HCAL in these presentation files. 

#### `data`
This folder contains SOME of the data and the analysis code that I used in this project. I generated the data but I did NOT write the code. I just made some changes in the code to make it work with my data.
